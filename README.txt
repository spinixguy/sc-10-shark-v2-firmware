This repository contains beta software for the SC-10 shark v2 3d printer. Use at your own risk.
I am creating these files for my personal use and cannot be held responsible for what it might 
do to your printer.

Lotmaxx-v0.5.zip is the original beta software from Lotmaxx. If you have not flashed the new 
graphics package then you will need to download this zip and flash your display with the included DWIN_SET.

SM3DP-lotmaxx-generic.bin is the beta software I compiled using the configuration from Lotmaxx.

SM3DP-ubl-4x4-2.08.bin is the beta software For Unified Bed Leveling.

SM3DP-mbl-4x4-2.08.bin is the beta software For Manual Mesh Bed Leveling.
